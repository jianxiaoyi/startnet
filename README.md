# startnet
Starknet was designed to allow developers to harness the power of STARKs and Cairo in order to build their app. Up till now, Starknet’s development focused on providing developers with future-proof functionality. Starknet’s functionality, powered by Cairo 1.0, is by now mostly complete, aside from Regenesis.

Regenesis
Starknet will go through Regenesis this year. This will be a seamless event for the network, as it will result in no down time and with no resetting of the network’s state.
